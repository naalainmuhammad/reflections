When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

Ans : I would like to use remote repository when I have working completely comfirmed version of my code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
with your remote repository?

Ans : If i made changes that i dont yet want to publically share, here manually will help me. Automatically staying up-to-date
 	will push that changes even if i dont want to.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Ans : Fork : to clone someone's repository on cloud(GitHub) and make changes on cloude using GitHub.

	
	Clones: to download an online repository to my computer or to make another repository of a repository on my local 
		computer.
	
	Branches: to make a version I dont want to yet add it to master.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Ans : I use sharing my project using email or other file sharing options . Easy in this case is no proceture of standard steps are 

	required to do this ..... Harder is that it would be difficult to view changes made by others and changes made by me .

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

Ans : When make changes not yet decided to add in my working code.
	Benifits are that we can make changes in a saperate branch, without effecting working version, test it again and agian untill we decided that fine change and can be added to 
	working version of code.
	
	If we update the master by our chages and it has a bug then then deffinitly that bug will be in you wrking version.
