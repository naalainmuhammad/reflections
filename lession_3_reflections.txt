When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

Ans : I would like to use remote repository when I have working completely comfirmed version of my code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
with your remote repository?

Ans : If i made changes that i dont yet want to publically share, here manually will help me. Automatically staying up-to-date
 	will push that changes even if i dont want to.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Ans : Fork : to clone someone's repository on cloud(GitHub) and make changes on cloude using GitHub.

	
	Clones: to download an online repository to my computer or to make another repository of a repository on my local 
		computer.
	
	Branches: to make a version I dont want to yet add it to master.
