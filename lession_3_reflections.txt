When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

Ans : I would like to use remote repository when I have working completely comfirmed version of my code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
with your remote repository?

Ans : If i made changes that i dont yet want to publically share, here manually will help me. Automatically staying up-to-date
 	will push that changes even if i dont want to.
